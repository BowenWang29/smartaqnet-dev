  "name" : "Air polution Monitoring Station (Urban Background Augsburg)",
  "description" : "The air pollution monitoring station is located at an urban background site in Augsburg, a mid-sized city with about 250 000 inhabitants in Bavaria, southern Germany. The monitoring station was placed on the campus of the University of Applied Sciences Augsburg which is approximately 1 km to the south-east of the city centre. The location was carefully selected taking the representativeness of a single monitoring station for the exposure of the general population to ultrafine particles into account. Details of the site and surroundings are described elsewhere.  (PMID:18754352)",
